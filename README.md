# CS 598: Final Project

This repository contains all the code and technical artifacts for my course project for _CS 598: Foundations of Data Curation_

## Project Description

For this project, I want to explore the ecological impacts of an AI data center by combining satellite image data from __Google Earth Engine__ with ecological data from _Cecil Earth_.
